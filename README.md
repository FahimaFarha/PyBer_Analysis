# PyBer_Analysis

## Resources Used
Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
Software: Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebook

## Part One Summary
The pyber_summary_df DataFrame shows us that Urban city types have the greatest total number of rides. And even though the average fare per ride in an Urban city is about $10 cheaper then the average fare per ride in a Rural city, Urban cities produce the greatest total fare. This is because you have to take into account that there are more people hailing a PyBer ride in a Urban setting. In a Rural setting things are more spread apart so people are more likely to either own a car or take the cheaper public transportation. 

## Part Two Summary
The Total Fare by City Type (Fig 8) multiple line graph shows us a trend that is similar to what we saw in the pyber_summary_df DataFrame. Urban cities have the highest total fare per month, while Rural cities have the lowest total fares. However, it is much easier to visualize with a mulitple line graph because each city type has its own designated line that is easy to follow.
